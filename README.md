My graduate work for university.
The goal is to create a computer game focusing on the implementation of basic mechanics, i.e. fighting various types of enemies controlled by artificial intelligence using a magic system.
Implemented core mechanics:
- 3 types of enemies 
- magic system that use combination of 4 types and 6 forms of magic
- system of interactive objects

There are also a bunch of secondary mechanics that give extra gaming experience. They are very simple: user interface, animation, collision control, player movement.

Language: C#
Game Engine: Unity
